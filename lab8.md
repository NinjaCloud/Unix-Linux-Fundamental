##  Linux Lab: Process Termination and Network Configuration

### ðŸ”¹ Process Termination with `kill` and `killall`

```bash
ps aux | grep sleep
```

Lists all running processes that include the word "sleep".

```bash
sleep 500 &
```

Starts a background process that runs for 500 seconds.

```bash
kill <PID>
```

Replaces `<PID>` with the actual process ID of the `sleep` command to terminate it.

```bash
killall sleep
```

Terminates all running instances of the `sleep` command.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Network Configuration with `ifconfig` and `ip`

```bash
ifconfig
```

Displays network interfaces and their configuration (may require installation on some systems).

```bash
ip addr
```

Shows detailed IP address information for all interfaces.

```
