# Understand and use basic Linux commands to display system information using `echo`, `uname`, `hostname`, and `uptime`.

---

Open your terminal and run the following commands one by one:

```bash
echo "Welcome to the Linux System Information Lab!"
```

This command displays a custom welcome message.

```bash
echo "System Kernel Name:"
uname
```

This prints the name of the kernel the system is using.

```bash
echo "Hostname of the System:"
hostname
```

This displays the network name of your machine.

```bash
echo "System Uptime:"
uptime
```
